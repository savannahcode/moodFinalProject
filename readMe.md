## &#128073;&#127996; [View Deployed Site Here](https://mood-mental-health.vercel.app/) &#128072;&#127996;

## Purpose &#128680;

### The idea behind this project is to:

- Help people track their emotions and mental health over time
- Get brief AI generated feedback to point them in the right direction
- Focus on pointing those in need to other people, rather than their devices
- To increase mindfulness & awareness of what may be impacting mental health

### Why did I want to develop a Mood Mental Health Helper?

- I’ve personally experienced mental health struggles to a small degree, and I’ve witnessed some close to me deal with them to a large degree.
- It can be helpful to track how you’re doing regularly, as well as stopping to take inventory of why you’re feeling that way.
- Those kinds of statistics would be helpful to share with a mental health professional.
- The addition of responses from Chat GPT would give some quickly accessible, unbiased source and responder to their initial responses. The goal would be to have ChatGPT to point users to real life people in the everyday, but especially if they’re struggling greatly with their mental health.

### Why is this project worth my final project?

- My personal connection to the cause of helping those with mental health struggles. This will help me be more passionate and motivated on the project to get it done.
- The use of AI in a project will give me great experience, not only in using APIs in general, but helping me learn the workings of AI in applying to projects. This understanding is crucial as AI becomes the “calculator” of our time. It will soon be just as widely used, if it’s not already, so it’s important for me to understand that technology and utilize it.
- If others were to use this site/app it would have a great social impact on those in need.
- It appears there are mood trackers out there, but a lot of them have horrible UI and are not very user friendly.
